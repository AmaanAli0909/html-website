            <p style="font-size: 20px; color: black;"> About 37 km from Agra, Fatehpur Sikri is a deserted city that was once the Mughal capital. Built by Emperor Akbar in the 16th century, the city is a remarkable example of Mughal architecture, with its grand courtyards, mosques, and palaces. The city was abandoned after just 14 years due to a shortage of water and political instability.

                    <li><b>History: </b> Fatehpur Sikri served as the capital of the Mughal Empire from 1571 to 1585. The Jama Masjid and Buland Darwaza (the largest gateway in the world) are notable landmarks in the city.</li> 
                    <li><b>Visiting Tip:</b> The city is largely uninhabited, but the structures within it remain intact, offering a glimpse into the grandeur of the Mughal era.</li>
